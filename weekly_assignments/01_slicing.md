# AI for medical imaging: individual assignment 1
## Data extraction, slicing and visualization
### Overview
The goal of this assignment is to unpack the data, slice it to individual .png slices (both the images and the labels), and to visualize them in two different ways: with the provided viewer, and 3D slicer.
This is also a good opportunity to manipulate in python the nifti files and 3D arrays.
