# Project Title

## Getting Started

For dependency management, I recommend to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast and lightweight drop-in replacement for `pip` as well as a Python version manager.

Otherwise, I recommend sticking to `pip` and `venv` to install the dependencies.

```bash
# If you don't have uv installed, you can install it using pip
# pip install uv
uv venv -p 3.12 # This will create a virtual environment with Python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate # This will activate the virtual environment
uv pip sync requirements.txt # Alternatively: uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linting and Formatting

It's recommended to always format your code on save with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). No recommendations for linting for this project.

```bash
uv tool update-shell # This will update your shell profile to include uv tools
uv tool install ruff
uvx ruff format
```
