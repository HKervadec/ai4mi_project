# Project Title

## Getting Started

For dependency management, I recommend to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast and lightweight drop-in replacement for `pip` as well as a Python version manager.

Otherwise, I recommend sticking to `pip` and `venv` to install the dependencies.


### Setting up the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danilotpnta/ai4mi_project.git
cd ai4mi_project
git submodule update --init


# If you don't have uv installed, you can install it using pip
# curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv -p 3.12 # This will create a virtual environment with Python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate # This will activate the virtual environment
uv pip sync requirements.txt # Alternatively: uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Snellius we need python>3.10
WORK_DIR=$HOME/ai4mi_project
cd $WORK_DIR

module load Python/3.11.3-GCCcore-12.3.0  # installs python 3.11 
python3 -m venv ai4mi
module purge 
source ai4mi/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_snellius.txt


```
### Downloading the dataset

```bash
uv tool install gdown
gdown -O data/ --folder 1-0wSgpMgTgJX9wybz4XTT-WxNy16kaE4
```

### Linting and Formatting

It's recommended to always format your code on save with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). No recommendations for linting for this project.

```bash
uv tool update-shell # This will update your shell profile to include uv tools
uv tool install ruff
uvx ruff format
```
