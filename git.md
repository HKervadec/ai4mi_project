# Git: Do and don't

As we want to encourage actively collaboration between the group members through git, some "smells" from the git history will be penalized:
- all commits were made by a single person;
- commit messages are short, uninformative or wildly inaccurate;
- diff spanning the whole project and not smaller parts of a few files at a time (grouped by logical idea).


While git can be used from the command line (and a decent mastery there is always useful), some other tools can prove very convenient, including [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) (my own personal choice), [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit), [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) and [many others](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
