Observations from slice_segthor.py
Lower torso:
- Intestines are visible, though they appear faint compared to other organs.
- Kidneys are present at the same height and stand out more clearly.

Mid torso:
- The liver can be seen on the left side, which leads me to believe the scans are flipped vertically as usually it is on the right.
- The stomach is also visible in this region.

Upper torso:
The heart is clearly visible.
The lungs appear with a tree-like structure.

Top slices:
- Shoulders and part of the neck are included.
- The brain is not part of these scans. Although I was hoping to see it. :D

Consistent features across all slices:
- Vertebrae are visible with their characteristic "pointy ends".
- The central canal, through which the spinal cord passes, is also seen.

Observations from Slicer 3D
- We can also see slices across the x and y directions, which is quite interesting.
- In one view, the scans of the bed on which the patient is lying are visible.
- The bones are clearly seen, including the ribs, spine, and shoulder bones.
- In another view, the S-shaped curvature of the spine is visible.
- The relative sizes of the organs are easier to compare, since they are shown one above the other in these orientations.
